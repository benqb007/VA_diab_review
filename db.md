Outcomes we hope to achieve over a 6- 12 month followup:
We aim to address 3 important aspects of metabolic disease
- BMI with corresponding waist reduction signifying visceral fat loss
- A1C reduction
- Medication reduction esp medications contributing to escalating insulin resistance and
insulin load as well as blood pressure medications.
- Additionally we are following Blood Pressure and lipids over time
We aim to address obesity with featured of metabolic syndrome. We will measure BMI with
corresponding waist reduction signifying visceral fat loss. We will also collect data on BP, lipids,
and A1C to assess for metabolic improvements.
Objectives
1. Weight loss:
Evaluate percent of patients that achieved 5%;
Evaluate percent of patients that achieved 10%
2. Insulin and Hypoglycemic agent use:
Evaluate percent of patients that were able to stop insulin ;
Evaluate percent of patients who reduced dose by more than 50%
Reduction of other glucose lowing medications
3. A1c reduction:
Evaluate percent of patients that achieved HbA1c less than 6.5%;
Evaluate percent of patients that reduced HbA1c by more than 1%
